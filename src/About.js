                Although there are various similar games, the Scattegories that we all know today was
                originaly published in 1988 by the Parker Brothers company which is now owned by
                Hasbro.

                The goal of this online Scattegories is very similar to the original board game with
                a few obvious differences. First, the user must play the three rounds of their game 
                consecutively, without any break in between rounds. Second, the user will not score 
                their own games. Once the user has completed their game, it will fall on to the other
                users to grade/score the game. The top scoring users will appear on a leaderboard for
                bragging rights.
